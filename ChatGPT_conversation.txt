Damped Harmonic Oscillator: Overview and Solutions
A damped harmonic oscillator is a system in which an object experiences both
restoring forces, which tend to bring it back to equilibrium, and damping forces,
which resist motion and dissipate energy. Such systems are common in physical
situations involving oscillations, such as a mass on a spring with friction, or a
pendulum in air, where the oscillations gradually decay over time due to energy
losses (e.g., through air resistance or internal friction).
1. Basic Concepts and Setup
In the simplest form, a harmonic oscillator is a system where the restoring force
is proportional to the displacement from equilibrium, as described by Hooke’s
law. However, in the presence of damping, an additional force is introduced
that is proportional to the velocity of the object.
Consider a mass m attached to a spring with spring constant k, moving on
a surface where a damping force b (where b is the damping coefficient) acts
opposite to the direction of motion. The total force acting on the mass is a
combination of: - **Restoring force**: −kx, where x is the displacement from
equilibrium. - **Damping force**: −b ˙x, where ˙x is the velocity.
The equation of motion for this system can be written as:
m¨x + b ˙x + kx = 0
where: - ¨x is the acceleration (second derivative of displacement with respect to
time), - ˙x is the velocity (first derivative of displacement), - x is the displacement
of the mass from the equilibrium position.
2. **Types of Damping**
The behavior of the system depends on the relative magnitude of the damp-
ing coefficient b and the mass m. There are three main types of damping:
- **Underdamped**: When b2 < 4mk, the damping force is small relative
to the restoring force, and the system undergoes oscillations that gradually
decay over time. - **Critically damped**: When b2 = 4mk, the system returns
1
to equilibrium as quickly as possible without oscillating. - **Overdamped**:
When b2 > 4mk, the damping force is so large that the system slowly returns
to equilibrium without oscillating.
3. **Equation of Motion**
The general second-order linear differential equation governing the motion
of the damped harmonic oscillator is:
m¨x + b ˙x + kx = 0
This can be simplified by dividing through by m:
¨x + 2ζω0 ˙x + ω2
0 x = 0
where: - ω0 =
q k
m is the natural frequency of the undamped oscillator, -
ζ = b
2√mk is the damping ratio, a dimensionless quantity that characterizes the
type of damping.
4. **Solution to the Equation of Motion**
To solve the equation, we first recognize that it is a second-order linear ho-
mogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients. The general solution
depends on the value of the damping ratio ζ.
**Underdamped Case ( ζ < 1 )**
For underdamping, the system still oscillates but with a gradually decreasing
amplitude. The solution to the equation is:
x(t) = Ae−ζω0t cos(ωdt + ϕ)
where: - A is the initial amplitude of oscillation, - ωd = ω0
p1 − ζ2 is the
damped angular frequency, - ϕ is the phase constant, which depends on the
initial conditions.
This solution describes oscillations with an exponentially decaying amplitude
over time due to the damping effect. The system oscillates with a frequency ωd,
which is lower than the natural frequency ω0 due to the damping.
**Critically Damped and Overdamped Cases**
For the critically damped case (ζ = 1), the solution is:
x(t) = (A + Bt)e−ω0t
This represents a non-oscillatory return to equilibrium, where the object moves
as quickly as possible to the equilibrium position without oscillating.
For the overdamped case (ζ > 1), the solution is:
x(t) = Aer1t + Ber2t
where r1 and r2 are the roots of the characteristic equation r2 + 2ζω0r + ω2
0 = 0.
These roots are real and distinct, and the solution describes a non-oscillatory
motion where the system slowly returns to equilibrium.
5. **Physical Interpretation**
2
In the underdamped regime, the system continues to oscillate, but with each
cycle, the amplitude of oscillation decreases due to the energy lost as heat or
other forms of dissipation through the damping force. This behavior is observed
in many physical systems, such as mechanical vibrations in car suspensions or
electrical circuits with resistive elements.
In the critically damped case, the system returns to equilibrium as quickly
as possible without oscillating, which is desirable in many applications where
quick stabilization is needed, such as in clock mechanisms or door closers.
In the overdamped case, the system returns to equilibrium slowly, and no
oscillations occur. This behavior can be seen in certain types of mechanical
systems with very strong damping, where a quick return to equilibrium is not
as important.
6. **Summary**
The damped harmonic oscillator is a fundamental system in physics and
engineering, modeling real-world systems where energy dissipation occurs. The
equation of motion governing this system is a second-order differential equation,
and its solution varies depending on the damping ratio. In the underdamped
case, the system oscillates with decreasing amplitude, while in the critically
and overdamped cases, the system returns to equilibrium without oscillations.
Understanding the behavior of such systems is crucial in designing everything
from mechanical systems to electrical circuits and even biological models.
